Improved version of PayPal Java SDK for AdaptivePayments. Changes:
- PPFaultMessage has verbose toString() method
- PayRequest has verbose toString() method
- httpclient is initialized once per instance, rather then per request
- httpclient can be injected
- httpclient upgraded to 4.1.2 version

TODO - use Jackson instead of Gson (should be simple?)

All copyrights goes to PayPal
